#AdherencePill Project Backend Implementation
In the back-end side, we mainly supply the **RESTful API** for the front-end side and provide the data to them so that in the front-end, people can only focus on the [page word](https://github.com/AdherencePillProject/web_cloud). No need to think about how to retrieve data and how to communicate with database.

Here, we will give introduce two important things for both the front-end and back-end people to have a better communication with each other.

##Structure of the Database
> ####**There are 6 important tables:**

```
1. User
2. Patient
3. Doctor
4. Appointment
5. Prescription
6. Schedule
```

>####**User**
This table is the most important table for the user management which is the build-in class of the Parse Server and it contains these fields:

```
```

>####**User**
