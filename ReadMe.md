#AdherencePill Project Backend Implementation
In the back-end side, we mainly supply the **RESTful API** for the front-end side and provide the data to them so that in the front-end, people can only focus on the [page word](https://github.com/AdherencePillProject/web_cloud). No need to think about how to retrieve data and how to communicate with database.

Here, we will give introduce two important things for both the front-end and back-end people to have a better communication with each other.
