This repository is the new structure of the web side development. The new structure is based on the MVC structure. We
use the Angularjs as the front end framework and nodejs express as the back end framework. The main purpose of this new
structure is to use REST API to complete the connection between front end and back end. We plan to use the PM2 to manage
the whole project in the future, use Nginx to do the load balance and Docker to deploy the web application. But for now,
our main purpose is the complete all the basic function of the web application. We will finish the structure as soon as
possible so that all of the contributors can work on this repository.
